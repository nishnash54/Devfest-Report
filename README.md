## Devfest Hackathon


The month long extensive hack aims to bring out developers with innovative solutions to real world problems. You will have the support of mentors who would guide you throughout the two week period. It is a platform to test your potential and in parallel, help you apply and improve your skills with the aid of experienced and supportive mentors. It is an unparalleled opportunity to build something incredible and employ a novel approach which could potentially solve problems for thousands of people. With time and expertise on your side, all you need is an eagerness to learn and a never give up attitude. There will be multiple reviews in which the top teams go through. The teams who qualify for the final round will get exclusive invites to the convention and get a chance to interact with the speakers one-on-one.
